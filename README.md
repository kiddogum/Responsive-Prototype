# Personal Responsive Design Project

This is a personal project that i build to increase my understanding of responsive design, responsive container, grid and flexbox

## Techstack

- React (Javascript framework for faster build)
- Vite (React build tool for faster development)
- Typescript (Javascript superset for safety checks)
- EsLint (for development type checks)
- Tailwind & CSS (For styling and animation, tailwind for faster and stronger css, css for flexibility)

## What do i gain from this personal project

i mostly gain comprehension about building a responsive container, as that is mostly the reason why i make this project. In this project i use 4 device queries as a base for responsive container, that is:

- Mobile for 320px - 766px,
- Tablet 768px - 1023px,
- Laptop 1024px - 1439px,
- Desktop 1440px and above.

This is my css code for responsive container:

```css
.mobile-container {
  width: auto;
  height: 100dvh;
  margin-inline: 12px;
}

.tablet-container {
  width: auto;
  height: 100dvh;
  margin-inline: 16px;
}

.laptop-container {
  width: 960;
  height: 100dvh;
  margin-inline: auto;
}

.desktop-container {
  width: auto;
  height: 1320;
  margin-inline: auto;
}
```
